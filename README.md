# Odin React Shopping Cart

This project is a practice project that was built in accordance with the [ODIN Project Shopping Cart assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-shopping-cart) to practice creating an SPA in React using client-side routing, and testing in React.

## Getting Started

Before getting started make sure you have the latest version of Node Package Manager (npm) installed.

If you think you will be using npm in the future for other projects, then I recommend downloading Node Version Manager (NVM) along with npm.

Then you will need to fork a copy of this repository to your Github account and then you can use the git clone command to clone your forked copy to your local environment

### NPM Version

This project uses   npm 10.9.2 and node 22.14.0

### Setting up your local environment

Once you've cloned your forked repository to your local environment, open the root of the project and run the following command to download all dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Then run the following command to launch the local server:
```
npm run dev
```

And you can find the live server at http://localhost:5173/
